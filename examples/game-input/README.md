# Ferp game input example

## Summary

This demonstrates how to handle input from up to 4 players on both keyboard and game pads.
The controls support is intentially limited to just directions, but there is nothing preventing a developer from adding full button and axis support.

## Running locally

Navigate to this directory in your terminal, and type in:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Now you can check out [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) and see it in action.

## See it live

You can find a less involved demo over [on codepen](https://codepen.io/mrozbarry/details/QVvQOj/).
