# ferp server example

An example of what a simple backend server could look like using ferp.
This is not a production server, and probably shouldn't be used for one.

## Running locally

Navigate to this directory in your terminal, and type:

```
npm install
npm start
```

And navigate to:

 - http://localhost:8080/ for a welcome message
 - http://localhost:8080/logs to see a list of hits to the web server
