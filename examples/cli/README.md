# Ferp CLI Examples

These are examples meant to run in a terminal.
All examples have `main.js`, which contains the app, `index.js` which executes it, and `main.test.js` that tests it.
Most applications should follow the structure of separate files for the app and execution code, since it makes testing a lot easier.
